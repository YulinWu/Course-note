    A42.00001: A blueprint for demonstrating quantum supremacy with superconducting qubits</a><br>
    <font size="-1">Invited Speaker: </font>
    <font size="-1">Charles Neill</font>
    <font size="-2"><p>Here, using nine superconducting qubits, we experimentally illustrate a blueprint for demonstrating quantum supremacy. We present data characterizing two basic ingredients required for any supremacy experiment: <i>complexity</i> and <i>fidelity</i>. First, we demonstrate that the qubits can uniformly explore the Hilbert-space, providing a direct measure of algorithm complexity. Next, we compare the measurement results with the expected behavior and show that the algorithm can be implemented with high fidelity. Experiments for probing complexity and fidelity provide a foundation for demonstrating quantum supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp; <span >&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr ><td width="25%" valign="top">

    A42.00005: Automatic calibration of arrays of superconducting qubits and couplers</a><br>
    <font size="-1">Kevin Satzinger, Brooks Foxen, Ben Chiaro, Matthew McEwen, John M Martinis</font>
    <font size="-2"><p>High-fidelity operation of superconducting qubits requires fine-tuning numerous experimental parameters. As superconducting qubit systems scale up to large arrays, automatic calibration becomes essential, both for bringing up systems from scratch and for maintaining calibrations. These algorithms depend strongly on the qubit architecture. For example, consider arrays of qubits connected by adjustable couplers, where the coupling can be turned off to isolate qubits and turned on to facilitate fast interactions. These couplers substantially complicate automatic calibration. At the start, the coupling may inadvertently be very strong, which can disrupt qubit bringup, and we can only learn about the coupler configuration indirectly through qubit measurements. In this presentation, we describe algorithms and experiments to automatically calibrate superconducting qubits and couplers. &nbsp;&nbsp; <span >&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;</font></td></tr>

    <font size="-1">Alexander Opremcak, Ben Chiaro, Brooks Foxen, Matthew McEwen, Robert F McDermott, John M Martinis</font>
    <font size="-2"><p>In a frequency-tunable transmon, transitions between the |0&gt; and |2&gt; states are nominally forbidden by selection rules, yet an experiment (Sank <i>et al.</i>, PRL 117) observed that it is possible to drive these transitions. In this talk we explain that observation. We show that the apparent selection rule violation is a direct consequence of parametric modulation of the Josephson energy of the compound junction of the device. From a theoretical analysis of the dc SQUID, we derive a drive term that explains the violation. We validate our theory using experimentally measured Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interferometry on the |0&gt; --&gt; |2&gt; transition. Surprisingly, the transition occurs for a transmon driven through a capacitor, indicating a modest degree of stray inductive coupling between the XY drive line and the compound junction of the transmon. These results identify a leakage channel and should inform efforts to integrate cryogenic control systems with arrays of frequency-tunable transmons. &nbsp;&nbsp; <span >&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;</font></td></tr>

    <font size="-1">Ben Chiaro, Brooks Foxen, Matthew McEwen, John M Martinis</font>
    <font size="-2"><p><br>Predicting the dynamics of quantum systems is a primary example of an intensive computational task that could be efficiently solved with a near term quantum computer.<br>To pursue this goal, we have fabricated a 9-qubit linear chain device made of superconducting circuits with nearest neighbor couplings. Our device is unique because it features frequency tunable qubits and an adjustable inter-qubit coupling strength, making it well suited to the simulation of quantum systems. We use the device to generate high-fidelity, multi-qubit, analog dynamics evolving under a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.<br>In this talk, we discuss the calibration of this device for quantum simulation. Once calibrated we use this device to probe the basic physics of thermalization. Specifically, we use transport measurements to distinguish localized and diffusive behavior. To complement this, we use echo techniques to characterize the propagation of entanglement in these regimes. This shows qualitative differences between how energy and entropy flow in the system. &nbsp;&nbsp; <span >&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;</font></td></tr>

In addition to the direct spectroscopy of the eigen-modes of the system, we generate controlled dynamics and measure the evolution of certain observables to refine the knowledge of the parameters obtained from spectroscopy.

    <font size="-2"><p>Precise and accurate coherent control of qubits is critical to the success of superconducting quantum computing. Microwave crosstalk is a ubiquitous problem for large scale superconducting quantum processors and poses a challenge to scaling up few-qubit coherent control results. Although crosstalk is classical, deterministic, and can be mitigated to some degree with electromagnetic nulling, the frequency dependence of crosstalk and significant calibration overhead for compensation schemes motivate hardware solutions. 3D integration techniques such as through silicon vias and bump bonds offer a solution at the cost of fabrication complexity. We propose and present initial experiments on a crosstalk mitigation scheme using commercial multilayer printed circuit boards (PCBs) to enable rapid turnaround and widespread adoption. &nbsp;&nbsp; <span >&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;</font></td></tr>

The NRZ format provides more signal power per unit bandwidth than RZ, and is easier to interface with CMOS circuitry. The output voltage is provided by a series of inductively isolated asymmetric DC superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). The power efficiency is estimated to be 32±9%. The DC SQUIDs are designed in-line with a 50 Ohm transmission line to reduce high frequency oscillation and improve output signal integrity. Experimentally, the output amplifier demonstrated a bit error rate of better than 9.5E-8 at 1 Gb/s; extrapolations to the optimal operating point project a bit error rate of 1E-37. &nbsp;&nbsp; <span >&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr ><td width="25%" valign="top">

    <font size="-2"><p>A robust cryogenic infrastructure in form of a wired, thermally optimized dilution refrigerator is essential for solid-state based quantum processors. In this talk, we present a cryogenic setup, which minimizes passive and active heat loads, while guaranteeing rapid qubit control and readout. We review design criteria for qubit drive lines, flux lines, and output lines used in typical experiments with superconducting circuits. The passive heat load of stainless steel and NbTi coaxial cables and the active load due to signal dissipation are measured, validating our robust and extensible concept for thermal anchoring of attenuators, cables, and other microwave components. Our results are important for managing the heat budget of future large-scale quantum computers based on superconducting circuits. &nbsp;&nbsp; <span >&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr ><td width="25%" valign="top">

    <font size="-2"><p>As quantum computers grow to increasing numbers of qubits, it becomes advantageous to use specialized or customized hardware to generate the microwave pulses that control the qubits. We present an FPGA-based system for controlling qubits that demonstrates a number of advantages over commercially available test equipment. The system has been optimized to minimize the noise sources to which the qubits are most susceptible, enabling high fidelity quantum gates. The overall architecture is designed to support hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. Optimized processor cores control the microwave signal generation and provide arbitrary control flow, allowing gates to be applied conditioned on a measurement result. Gate parameters, such as rotation angle, can also be dynamically computed, or loaded from classical shared memory, and applied in real-time. We present results from a straightforward usage of this capability: actively resetting a qubit to its ground state. &nbsp;&nbsp; <span >&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr ><td width="25%" valign="top">

    V26.00012: Scaling the input/output architecture of quantum processors to kQbit, and beyond, size in the NISQ era</a><br>

    <font size="-2"><p>Most quantum computing hardware architectures combine the requirements of individually addressable qubits and cryogenic temperatures of the quantum processor. This combination makes the design of the interface between the quantum processor and its classical backend a critical element in the scalability of the architecture of the quantum computer. Todays coaxial cabling solution becomes (at best) impractical for processors beyond the kQbit regime, due to its unwanted resonances, form-factor, costs and thermal load. Moreover the non-uniformity of the individual lines complicates the operation and control of the quantum processor by its classical back-end. Here we discuss an input/output (i/o) system for scalable quantum computers that uses a monolithic multi-layer flexible circuit from room temperature to ~10 miliKelvin to interface the quantum processor with its room temperature electronics. Important aspects like thermal properties, signal transmission and conditioning by integrated filtering, and cross-talk are reviewed for the various approaches to quantum computing. Also the required modularity and inter-operability of the cryogenic hardware and interface to the quantum processor are considered. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span >&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr ><td width="25%" valign="top">

    <font size="-2"><p>As quantum computing technology evolves from research laboratories to potential industrial applications, the scalability and synchronization of classical control hardware becomes a limiting factor in the development of intermediate-scale (50-100) qubit systems. We introduce a novel FPGA-based architecture comprised of multiple qubit control boards, interconnected by a fiber-based synchronization system, to implement basic operations such as qubit control and readout. Our hardware represents a cost-effective alternative to commercial test and measurement style AWGs and detectors, and can be readily scaled up for intermediate-scale quantum processors with low latency and synchronization among all channels to a common clock cycle. Having assembled a prototype system with commercial evaluation boards, we present results from bench testing of the hardware and initial tests demonstrating qubit control. Customized hardware with higher channel density is under development.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span >&nbsp;</span></p>&nbsp;</font></td></tr>
